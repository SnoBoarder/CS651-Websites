HW3

The following are the steps to use the my handlers for HTML files within IIS:
- Copy the folder "hw3" inside of the following directory:
	ExampleIISDirectory/wwwroot
- Paste the folder into the following directory:
	C:\inetpub\wwwroot
- Open Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager
- In the left column, expand the "Sites" directory until you see the "hw3" folder.
- Right click the "hw3" folder and "Convert to Application"
- Open your preferred browser (I suggest Chrome)
- View the handler working by going to one of the following URLs:
	http://localhost/hw3/Example1.html
	http://localhost/hw3/Example2.html

Enjoy!
